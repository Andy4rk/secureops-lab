# Wazuh Configuration and Usage

This directory documents how Wazuh is deployed and used in the lab to collect logs, run SCA/OSCAP checks, and generate security alerts.

## Deployment Overview

- **Wazuh version:** 4.14.1 (single-node)
- **Host OS:** Ubuntu Server VM on Proxmox
- **Components:**
  - Wazuh indexer
  - Wazuh server
  - Wazuh dashboard
- **Agents installed on:**
  - Windows 11 endpoint
  - Kali Linux VMs

## Key Configuration

> Configuration files will be added here as they are sanitized and exported.

Planned files:

- `ossec.conf` – main Wazuh manager configuration (sanitized)
- `local_rules.xml` – custom rules and tuned detections
- `sca_policies/` – any custom or modified SCA policies
- `oscap/` – scripts or configs for running OSCAP via Wazuh

## Custom Rules and Detections

Wazuh is used not only for basic log collection, but also for custom detections.

Examples (to be documented):

- Alerts for specific OSCAP / SCA findings
- Detection of misconfigurations or failed hardening checks
- Windows security events that indicate policy violations

As rules are finalized, they will be added here with:

- The rule ID
- A short description
- The log pattern or condition
- What the alert means in the context of the lab

## SCA / OSCAP Integration

SCA and OSCAP scans are used to check system configuration against security baselines.

- Initial scans have been run against:
  - Ubuntu Server (Wazuh host)
  - Windows 11 endpoint
- Results are visible in the Wazuh dashboard and captured under `docs/screenshots/`.

Future additions:

- Automation scripts for running and exporting OSCAP scans
- Notes on how specific Wazuh SCA checks map back to NIST 800-53 control families

## Validation and Evidence

Screenshots of the Wazuh dashboard and SCA / OSCAP results are stored in:

- `../docs/screenshots/`

Each screenshot is intended to show:

- That agents are connected and sending data
- That SCA / OSCAP scans have run successfully
- Example alerts and findings generated by the lab
